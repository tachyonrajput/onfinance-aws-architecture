# OnFinance AWS EKS Implementation

A scalable, secure cloud architecture implementation on AWS EKS.

## Stages Overview

### Stage 1: High-Level Architecture Design

A multi-AZ AWS architecture designed for high availability and scalability:
- EKS Kubernetes cluster spanning multiple availability zones
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- RDS with Multi-AZ for database reliability
- S3 for object storage
- IAM roles following least privilege principle

### Stage 2: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Automated infrastructure provisioning with Terraform:
- Modular approach with reusable components
- Networking stack (VPC, subnets, routing)
- EKS cluster with properly configured node groups
- Database resources with high availability
- Object storage with proper security settings
- Infrastructure defined as versioned code

### Stage 3: Kubernetes Deployment

Sample application deployment on EKS:
- Backend API service with multiple replicas
- Frontend web service exposed via LoadBalancer
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration
- Liveness and readiness probes for self-healing
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for automatic scaling
- Proper resource requests and limits

### Stage 4: Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive observability solution:
- Centralized logging with Fluent Bit and CloudWatch
- Kubernetes metrics collection with metrics-server
- CloudWatch Container Insights for detailed metrics
- Automated alerts via CloudWatch Alarms and SNS
- Multi-AZ reliability for monitoring infrastructure

### Stage 5: External Data Integration

Data pipeline for financial market information:
- Automated data fetching from public financial APIs
- Secure storage of credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- S3 for raw data archival
- DynamoDB for processed data
- Scheduled execution via AWS Lambda or Kubernetes CronJob
